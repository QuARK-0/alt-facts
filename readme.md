## Technology Used

#### Front End: 
HTML | CSS | Javascript | jQuery | AJAX | Bulma.io

#### Back End:
Node.js | Express | Socket.io | MongoDB / Mongoose | Handlebars.js | JSService.io

## Getting Started

Gather 2 friends, login and click the ready button.

When a question is displayed, enter a believable "fake" answer.

The aim of the game is not only to answer the trivia question correctly but also to trick your opponent into selecting your "fake" answer. 

Scoring is 1000 points for selecting the correct answer and 1000 points for every opponent that selects your "fake" answer.

Note that the game auto-disconnects any user attempting to join the game once the room is full. (current capacity is 2 players)
