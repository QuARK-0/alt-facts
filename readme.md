## Technology Used

#### Front End: 
HTML | CSS | Javascript | jQuery | AJAX | Bulma.io

#### Back End:
Node.js | Express | Socket.io | MongoDB / Mongoose | Handlebars.js | JSService.io

## Getting Started

If you have ever played Psych or Fibbage, this is a similar game.

Gather 2 friends, login and click the ready button.

When a question is displayed, enter a believable "fake" answer.

The aim of the game is not only to answer the trivia question correctly but also to trick your opponent into selecting your "fake" answer. 

Scoring is 1000 points for selecting the correct answer and 1000 points for every opponent that selects your "fake" answer.

Note that the game auto-disconnects any user attempting to join the game once the room is full. (current capacity is 2 players)

### Project Planning

[User Stories](../master/planning/user-stories.md)

[Api Routes](../master/planning/rest-api-routes.md)

[Wireframes](../master/planning/wireframes)

### Approach

This was our first group project at GA made in a sprint of 4 days. This was all of our first experience with [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) and this was an ambitious attempt to create a real-time party game!

We came up with the appropriate user stories 

While some groups prefer to split work between front and back-end. Our group preferred to split tasks by feature and be responsible for output entirely for that feature from front to end.

## Next Steps

### Unsolved Issues
- Timer disappears after first question
- Crude disconnection handling of users attempting to join full game
- 

### Planned Features
- Multiple rooms/game instances
- Chat for 
- More fun questions
- Match history and archive score on profile page
-
